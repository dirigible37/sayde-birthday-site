- [x] Initialized Vite React TypeScript project structure
- [x] Project scaffolding complete

## Next Steps ðŸš§
- [ ] Install dependencies (`npm install`)
- [ ] Set up Tailwind CSS v4 configuration
- [ ] Create blue background gradient component
- [ ] Build yellow brick road SVG component
- [ ] Implement scroll animation system with Intersection Observer
- [ ] Create scroll item components for left/right reveals
- [ ] Build present reveal animation component
- [ ] Set up main App component with scrolling layout
- [ ] Configure Netlify deployment
- [ ] Test and optimize for mobile devices

## Technical Architecture

### Framework & Tools
- **React 18** + **TypeScript** for robust component development
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS v4** with semantic color system (based on coding-platform/client)
- **Netlify** for static hosting and deployment

## Visual Design Concept

### Layout
- **Full-height sections**: Each scroll section fills viewport height
- **Blue gradient background**: Beautiful sky-like gradient from light to deep blue
- **Winding yellow brick road**: SVG path that curves naturally from top to bottom
- **Side revelations**: Content appears on alternating left/right sides as user scrolls

### Animation System
- **Intersection Observer**: Efficient scroll-based triggers
- **Progressive revelation**: Road extends as user scrolls down
- **Smooth transitions**: CSS transforms with easing functions
- **Mobile optimized**: Touch-friendly and performant on all devices

### Content Strategy
1. **Opening**: Welcome message and journey start
2. **Memory lane**: Photos, stories, inside jokes
3. **Hints & clues**: Building anticipation
4. **The reveal**: Dramatic present unveiling with celebration animation

## Technical Features

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy loading**: Components load as they enter viewport
- **Efficient animations**: Hardware-accelerated CSS transforms
- **Optimized assets**: Compressed images and SVGs
- **Fast builds**: Vite's lightning-fast development and production builds

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-first**: Designed for phones, enhanced for desktop
- **Flexible layouts**: Adapts to all screen sizes
- **Touch interactions**: Smooth scrolling on mobile devices

### Accessibility
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmarks
- **Color contrast**: Meeting WCAG AA standards
- **Screen reader friendly**: Alt text and ARIA labels
- **Keyboard navigation**: Full accessibility support

## Deployment Strategy

### Netlify Configuration
- **Automatic builds**: Connected to Git repository
- **Custom domain**: Optional personalized URL
- **Performance monitoring**: Core Web Vitals tracking
- **HTTPS**: Secure connection by default

### Build Optimization
- **Tree shaking**: Unused code elimination
- **Asset optimization**: Automatic image and CSS optimization
- **Caching strategy**: Efficient browser caching headers

## Development Workflow

1. **Setup Phase**: Dependencies and tooling configuration
2. **Visual Components**: Background, road, and layout components
3. **Animation System**: Scroll detection and progressive reveals
4. **Content Integration**: Adding personal touches and story elements
5. **Polish & Testing**: Mobile optimization and performance tuning
6. **Deployment**: Netlify setup and domain configuration
